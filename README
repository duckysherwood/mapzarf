======= What is mapzarf?

Mapzarf is Javascript (with a tiny dollop of HTML) for creating controls
which I commonly want to have for my maps.  I frequently wanted to switch
choropleth (polygon) layers, switch dot layers, switch between cartogram
and mercator, show city names (or not), show borders (or not), show
a marker, change the starting display based on the query string, and so on.  
This framework lets me specify all those things (and a 
few more) based on one JSON file.

======= What is NOT covered by the JSON file?

Two things:
1. It doesn't make the tiles.  You need to find tiles yourself.  The
JSON file allows you to specify the fields which *I* need to get *my*
tiles out of my tile mapping framework.  To get other tiles, you 
will need to modify at a minimum
   MapBehavior.getPolygonLayer
   MapBehavior.getDotLayer
and will probably need to change what information is specified in the JSON
file (mapApplicationInfo.js) as well.
2. They layout and presentation of the page; that's covered by the HTML and CSS.
You can put the various pieces of the page anywhere you want by changing
those.

======= Can I put two maps on one page?
Not yet, but the way the code is structured, it shouldn't be too hard
to add that someday.  (I haven't figured out how to specify which 
controls should be shared between the two and which should be separate,
for one.)


======= Why mapzarf?

I decided that if I was going to put this on github, I would need to 
call it something different than "my generalized map framework".  
I know that it is easier to find something on the Web if it has a unique
name, so I started thinking about obscure words which I liked.  I like 
"zarf", and not just because it is worth hella points in Scrabble.

A zarf is "a cup which holds a glass", and I realized that it was a good
word for this project: it is the HTML/javascript which holds a map.  
And combining map+zarf made it unique.
