<h1>Using Mapzarf</h1>
<i>TBD: make prettier.</i><br>
<i>Split into multiple pages</i>
<p>

Mapzarf builds a tile-based map application from a data file.  Here is a 
screenshot of an example:<p>
<a href="http://maps.webfoot.com/demos/congress2012/mapzarf.html?lat=40.865756786006806&lng=-74.42413330078125&zoom=8&cartogram=f&showCities=t&markerLat=40.17467622056341&markerLng=-76.0528564453125&showDotLayers=t&showChoroplethLayers=t&choroplethLayersIndex=2&showBorderLayers=t&borderLayersIndex=0">

(Click on the image to go to the web page of the example.)

In the image, you can see that there's a map, some city names, a marker
with a popup, some text, some dropdowns, and some checkboxes.  Almost
all of that is specified in a JSON file called the <i>Map Application Info</i> 
or <i>MAI</i> file.  If you clicked on the image, you'll see that the 
app can grab information from the query string for how to initialize the 
map so that User1 can show User2 what he or she was looking at.
Mapzarf handles interpreting the data file and making it all happen.


<h2>Building up the map application</h2>
Let's build up a map application in stages.
<p>
You need three things: a .html file, a .css file, and a .json file.

<h3>HTML and CSS files</h3>
You can find templates for the HTML file and the CSS file on github:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/master/mapzarfDemo.html">HTML</a> and 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/master/mapzarfDemo.css">CSS</a>.
<p>
The only thing you should need to change in the HTML and CSS file is 
the location of the Leaflet .js file, and the location of the mapzarf
code (e.g. mapzarfAll.js or mapzarfAllCompressed.js or the individual files).
Change the HTML which looks like this:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- FIXME TODO NOTE Set this to the locations of your Leaflet
         and mapzarf CSS files!  NOTE TOTO FIXME --&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/thirdparty/leaflet/Leaflet-0.6.4/leaflet.css"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/mapzarf/mapzarfDemo.css"&gt;
</pre>
Wellllllllllll, you probably also want to remove the text about cartograms in
the HTML file.  Almost nobody even knows what a cartogram <i>is</i> and even 
fewer people care.  (Why is it there?  Because I care, and to date I'm 
the only person using Mapzarf.)  (So why am I documenting it?  Because
there is zero chance anyone else will ever use mapzarf if I don't document it.)

<h3>MAI file</h3>
Now on to <b>MAI</b> file.
<p>
The MAI file is JSON, and as such, it is really stupid-easy to make
a mistake in the syntax.  I strongly suggest that you become good friends
with a JSON validator; a JSON validator will make your life hugely better.
<a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> and 
<a href="http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">JSON Formatter</a> are both
great tools.
<p>

While most MAI files will have more fields, the smallest MAI file has four 
fields:
<ul>
<li>pageTitle: The title of the page, a string which tells what should 
appear in the title bar of the browser when you are on the application's 
page.</li>
<li>pageDescription: A little bit of text to explain to your users what the
map shows, how to interpret it, and/or why they should care.</li>
<li>attribution: YOUR NAME HERE!  This is where you get to say who you are,
so that your users will know where to send their praise and reverence.</li>
<li>layersets: This is a JSON array of layers, which we will discuss later.
It can be empty (as we'll show in a moment), but it's a pretty dull app
with no layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example of a minimum MAI file.  (It also happens to be the
MAI file used for the 
<a href="https://github.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/tree/master/integrationTest/testIncompleteMai2.html">test named testIncompleteMai2</a>.)
<pre>
{
   "pageTitle":"TestIncompleteMai2 pageTitle",
   "pageDescription":"IncompleteMai2 pageDescription",
   "attribution":"Kaitlin Duck Sherwood",
   "layersets":[

   ]
}
</pre>

It makes an application which looks like this (pretty boring):<p>
<img src="./testIncompleteMai2.png"><p>

<h2>One-layer map</h2>
You really want to have, like, a <i>map</i> on your map application.
So add a layer to the layersets:
<pre>
{ "pageTitle":"One layer pageTitle",
   "pageDescription":"One layer pageDescription",
   "attribution":"Kaitlin Duck Sherwood",
   "layersets":[ {
         "shortName" : "arbitrary",
         "displayName" : "street map",
         "layers":[ {
               "shortName" : "mapnik",
               "tileEngine" : "bare",
               "tileEngineVersion" : 1.0,
               "url" : "http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png"   
            } ] } ] }
</pre>
The page now looks like this:<p>
<img src="oneLayer.png"><p>

The first thing you probably notice in the MAI is the <i>layerset</i> stuff.
We'll come back to that.  Focus for the moment on the <i>layers</i> stuff.
<p>
There are several different types of layer which you can specify, but
the "bare" one shown above is probably what you will be using most.
It has four required fields: 
<ul>
<li>shortName: a name which the user might see on a dropdown (if there is 
more than one layer) and which is used internally for an id.  Note: you can 
only have letters and numbers -- no spaces or symbols -- in the shortName</li>
<li>tileEngine: the name of the code which generates that type of tile layer.  
The other possibilities right now are for tiles which I (Ducky Sherwood)
generate.  If you want to make a custom layer for whatever you
are doing, great, go for it!  Send me a pull request and I will incorporate 
it.</li>
<li>tileEngineVersion: the version number of the tile engine.  </li>
<li>url: This is the URL to the tile layer.  This particular URL points
to Open Street Map map tiles.  Note that the URL should 
include tile x, y, and zoom coordinates in the query string, which Leaflet 
will fill in.  (Note that Leaflet needs curly braces around {x}, {y}, and {z},
but that <i>here</i> the curly braces need to be URL-encoded.)
</ul>
<p>
<h2>More description</h2>
To be a good online citizen, you really should provide information 
about the map tiles which you use, especially if someone else provides
the tiles.  Not only is it polite, but it will keep noobs from asking
you questions that really should go to the tile provider.  In the layer
spec, there are lots of things you can describe:
<ul>
<li>shortDescription: The short description overrides shortName for 
showing on the drop-down menu (if it is there).</li>
<li>description: A long, more detailed description of the layer, which
will appear underneath the drop-down or checkbox.</li>
<li>sourceUrl: The URL that someone can go to to find more information on
how the tile was made, e.g. what data was used to make the tile.</li>
<li>provider: The name of the organization which provided the tile.</li>
<li>providerUrl: A URL where the user can find out more about the organization
which provided the tile.</li>
<li>license: A description of the license the tile is used under.</li>
<li>lincenseUrl: A URL where the user can find out more about the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
