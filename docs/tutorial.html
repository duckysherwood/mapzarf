<h1>Using Mapzarf</h1>
<i>TBD: make prettier.</i><br>
<i>Split into multiple pages</i>
<p>

Mapzarf builds a tile-based map application from a data file.  Here is a 
screenshot of an example:<p>
<a href="http://maps.webfoot.com/demos/congress2012/mapzarf.html?lat=40.865756786006806&lng=-74.42413330078125&zoom=8&cartogram=f&showCities=t&markerLat=40.17467622056341&markerLng=-76.0528564453125&showDotLayers=t&showChoroplethLayers=t&choroplethLayersIndex=2&showBorderLayers=t&borderLayersIndex=0">
<img src="./congr2012.png"></a><p>
(Click on the image to go to the web page of the example.)

In the image, you can see that there's a map, some city names, a marker
with a popup, some text, some dropdowns, and some checkboxes.  Almost
all of that is specified in a JSON file called the <i>Map Application Info</i> 
or <i>MAI</i> file.  If you clicked on the image, you'll see that the 
app can grab information from the query string for how to initialize the 
map so that User1 can show User2 what he or she was looking at.
Mapzarf handles interpreting the data file and making it all happen.


<h2>Building up the map application</h2>
Let's build up a map application in stages.
<p>
You need three things: a .html file, a .css file, and a .json file.

<h3>HTML and CSS files</h3>
You can find templates for the HTML file and the CSS file on github:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/master/mapzarfDemo.html">HTML</a> and 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/master/mapzarfDemo.css">CSS</a>.
<p>
The only thing you should need to change in the HTML and CSS file is 
the location of the Leaflet .js file, and the location of the mapzarf
code (e.g. mapzarfAll.js or mapzarfAllCompressed.js or the individual files).
Change the HTML which looks like this:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- FIXME TODO NOTE Set this to the locations of your Leaflet
         and mapzarf CSS files!  NOTE TOTO FIXME --&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/thirdparty/leaflet/Leaflet-0.6.4/leaflet.css"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/mapzarf/mapzarfDemo.css"&gt;
</pre>
Wellllllllllll, you probably also want to remove the text about cartograms in
the HTML file.  Almost nobody even knows what a cartogram <i>is</i> and even 
fewer people care.  (Why is it there?  Because I care, and to date I'm 
the only person using Mapzarf.)  (So why am I documenting it?  Because
there is zero chance anyone else will ever use mapzarf if I don't document it.)

<h3>MAI file</h3>
Now on to <b>MAI</b> file.
<p>
The MAI file is JSON, and as such, it is really stupid-easy to make
a mistake in the syntax.  I strongly suggest that you become good friends
with a JSON validator; a JSON validator will make your life hugely better.
<a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> and 
<a href="http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">JSON Formatter</a> are both
great tools.
<p>

While most MAI files will have more fields, the smallest MAI file has four 
fields:
<ul>
<li><b>pageTitle</b>: The title of the page, a string which tells what should 
appear in the title bar of the browser when you are on the application's 
page.</li>
<li><b>pageDescription</b>: A little bit of text to explain to your users what 
the map shows, how to interpret it, and/or why they should care.</li>
<li><b>attribution</b>: YOUR NAME HERE!  This is where you get to say who you 
are, so that your users will know where to send their praise and reverence.</li>
<li><b>layersets</b>: This is a JSON array of layers, which we will discuss 
later.  It can be empty (as we'll show in a moment), but it's a pretty dull 
app with no layersets.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example of a minimum MAI file.  (It also happens to be the
MAI file used for the 
<a href="https://github.com/duckysherwood/mapzarf/tree/master/integrationTest/testIncompleteMai2.html">test named testIncompleteMai2</a>.)
<pre>
{
   "pageTitle":"TestIncompleteMai2 pageTitle",
   "pageDescription":"IncompleteMai2 pageDescription",
   "attribution":"Kaitlin Duck Sherwood",
   "layersets":[

   ]
}
</pre>

It makes an application which looks like this (pretty boring):<p>
<img src="./testIncompleteMai2.png"><p>

<h2>One-layer map</h2>
You really want to have, like, a <i>map</i> on your map application.
So add a layer to the layersets:
<pre>
{ "pageTitle":"One layer pageTitle",
   "pageDescription":"One layer pageDescription",
   "attribution":"Kaitlin Duck Sherwood",
   "layersets":[ {
         "shortName" : "arbitrary",
         "displayName" : "street map",
         "layers":[ {
               "shortName" : "mapnik",
               "tileEngine" : "bare",
               "tileEngineVersion" : 1.0,
               "url" : "http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png"   
            } ] } ] }
</pre>
The page now looks like this:<p>
<img src="oneLayer.png"><p>

The first thing you probably notice in the MAI is the <i>layerset</i> stuff.
We'll come back to that.  Focus for the moment on the <i>layers</i> stuff.
<p>
There are several different types of layer which you can specify, but
the "bare" one shown above is probably what you will be using most.
It has four required fields: 
<ul>
<li><b>shortName</b>: a name which the user might see on a dropdown (if there is 
more than one layer) and which is used internally for an id.  Note: you can 
only have letters and numbers -- no spaces or symbols -- in the shortName</li>
<li><b>tileEngine</b>: the name of the code which generates that type of tile layer.  
The other possibilities right now are for tiles which I (Ducky Sherwood)
generate.  If you want to make a custom layer for whatever you
are doing, great, go for it!  Send me a pull request and I will incorporate 
it.</li>
<li><b>tileEngineVersion</b>: the version number of the tile engine.  </li>
<li><b>url</b>: This is the URL to the tile layer.  This particular URL points
to Open Street Map map tiles.  Note that the URL should 
include tile x, y, and zoom coordinates in the query string, which Leaflet 
will fill in.  (Note that 
<a href="http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#tilelayer">Leaflet needs curly 
braces around {x}, {y}, and {z}</a>,
but that <i>here</i> the curly braces need to be URL-encoded: %7B for "{" and 
%7D for "}".)
</ul>
<p>
<h2>More description</h2>
The information about the layer using the above MAI file isn't very interesting:
<p>
<img src="./oneLayerCloseup.png">
<p>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> From here on, I'm only going show <i>pieces</i> of screenshots. 
The whole screenshot takes up a lot of room and most of it isn't very 
interesting.</i>
<p>
To be a good online citizen, you really should provide better information 
about the map tiles which you use, especially if someone else provides
the tiles.  Not only is it polite, but it will keep noobs from asking
you questions that really should go to the tile provider.  In the layer
spec, there are lots of things you can describe:
<ul>
<li><b>shortDescription</b>: The short description overrides shortName for 
showing on the drop-down menu (if it is there).</li>
<li><b>description</b>: A long, more detailed description of the layer, which
will appear underneath the drop-down or checkbox.</li>
<li><b>sourceUrl</b>: The URL that someone can go to to find more information on
how the tile was made, e.g. what data was used to make the tile.</li>
<li><b>provider</b>: The name of the organization which provided the tile.</li>
<li><b>providerUrl</b>: A URL where the user can find out more about the organization
which provided the tile.</li>
<li><b>license</b>: A description of the license the tile is used under.</li>
<li><b>lincenseUrl</b>: A URL where the user can find out more about the license.</li>
<li><b>year</b>: The year the data on the tile came from.</li>
</ul>

If, for example, you use this as the layer spec, you will get a much nicer
description.
<pre>
       {
          "shortName" : "mapnik",
          "tileEngine" : "bare",
          "tileEngineVersion" : 2,
          "shortDescription" : "OSM Mapnik",
          "description" : "Open Street Maps Mapnik layer",
          "sourceUrl" : "http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers",
          "url" : "http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png",
          "provider" : "Open Street Maps",
          "providerUrl" : "http://openstreetmap.org",
          "license" : "ODbL and CC BY-SA",
          "licenseUrl" : "http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright",
          "year" : 2014
       }
</pre>

Gives:<p>
<img src="./oneLayerBetterDescription.png"><p>

<h2>Multiple layers</h2>
Suppose you want to let users choose between showing two different types
of data.  For example, you want to let them see the locations of libraries
in the US.  In that case, you put another layer object in the same layerset. 
For example, add this (metadata information omitted for brevity):
<pre>
   {
      "shortName" : "libraries",
      "tileEngine" : "bare",
      "tileEngineVersion" : 2,
      "shortDescription" : "Libraries",
      "url" : "http://localhost/maps/mapeteria2/dots.php?x=%7Bx%7D&amp;y=%7By%7D&amp;zoom=%7Bz%7D&amp;points=dotAttributes&amp;name=library&amp;year=2010&amp;colour=ff0000&amp;size=1&amp;jid=0"
  }
</pre>
That will give you a page which has a drop-down menu letting you select
which layer to look at; here the libraries layer is selected.<p>
<img src="libraries.png">

<h2>Multiple layersets</h2>

Now, it probably would be nicer to see the library dots <i>on top of</i>
the Open Street Map map.  To do that, put the library dots in a different
<i>layerset</i> from the Open Street Map map.

Each layerset can show one layer at a time.  So if you have two layersets,
then you can see two layers at a time.  Each layerset can have multiple layers,
selectable with a dropdown menu, but only one layer from each layerset will
be visible at one time.  Here is an example (with most metadata removed for 
brevity) of a snipped of a MAI with two layersets; the first layerset has
two layers:

<pre>
   "layersets":[
      {
         "shortName":"maps",
         "displayName":"street map",
         "layers":[ {
               "shortName":"mapnik",
               "tileEngine":"bare",
               "tileEngineVersion":1.0,
               "url":"http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png"
            }, {
               "shortName" : "mapquest",
               "tileEngine" : "bare",
               "tileEngineVersion" : 2,
               "url" : "http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png" 
            } ] }, { 
         "shortName":"dots",
         "displayName":"street map",
         "layers":[ {
               "shortName":"libraries",
               "tileEngine":"bare",
               "tileEngineVersion":1.0,
               "url":"http://localhost/maps/mapeteria2/dots.php?x=%7Bx%7D&amp;y=%7By%7D&amp;zoom=%7Bz%7D&amp;points=dotAttributes&amp;name=libraryt&amp;year=2010&amp;colour=ff0000&amp;size=1&amp;jid=0"
            } ] } ] }
</pre>

Each layerset has three required fields (and no optional fields):
<ul>
<li>shortName: an arbitrary identifier (made up of letters and numbers), used
internally.  (Pro tip: While it can be anything, if you get into debugging, 
you will be happier if you make it a meaningful identifier.)</li>
<li>displayName: the text which will describe the layerset to the user if there 
is more than one layer.  ("Show" will be prepended and "layers" will be 
appended.)</li>
<li>layers: An array of layers, as before.</li>
</ul>

<img src="./twoLayersets.png"><p>

<h2>Setting the starting location</h2>
You can customize the starting location of the map with several MAI
fields (at the top level):
<ul>
<li><b>startingCenterLat</b>: The latitude where the map's center should be at 
first (a floating-point number, with Southern Hemisphere being negative).</li>
<li><b>startingCenterLng</b>: The longitude where the map's center should be at 
first (a floating-point number, with longitudes west of Grenich being negative).
</li>
<li><b>startingCenterZoom</b>: The zoom where the map should be at first (an integer).</li>
</ul>

For example, using the layersets from the above ("twoLayersets") example<p>

<pre>
{
   "pageTitle":"Two layersets zoomed in",
   "pageDescription":"Two layersets zoomed in",
   "attribution":"Kaitlin Duck Sherwood",
   "startingCenterLat" : 40.0,
   "startingCenterLng" : -79.0,
   "startingCenterZoom" : 7,
   "layersets":[ &lt;as above&gt; ]
}
</pre>

gives a page where a piece of the page looks like this:<p>
<img src="zoomedIn.png"><p>

You can also set the <b>minZoom</b> and <b>maxZoom</b>, which prevent the user from
zooming in/out past those limits.  However, that's hard to show with a
still photo.


<h2>Legends</h2>
If you want to show a legend for a particular layer, in the layerSpec,
give the URL to the legend in the <b>legendUrl</b> field.  This URL
can be to any image.  For example, if I add 
<pre>
               "legendUrl" : "http://webfoot.com/pictures/webfoot.gif",
</pre>
to the "mapnik" layerSpec in the previous example, I get a screenshot which
looks like this:<p>
<img src="legend.png"><p>

If you have multiple visible layers (because you have multiple layersets) 
and more than one has a legend, the legends will "stack" from left to right.  
Note that if you are going to have multiple legends, you probably want
to have the name of the layer in the image, so people can tell which
legend goes with which layer.

<h2>Marker</h2>
You might like to have a marker on the map which tells people about
spots on the map.  These MAI fields (at the top level, i.e. not part of
the layerset or layers) control where the marker is at first.
<ul>
<li><b>startingMarkerLat</b>: The latitude where the marker should start.</li>
<li><b>startingMarkerLng</b>: The longitude where the marker should start.</li>
</ul>

If you look at the very first screenshot in the tutorial, you will see a
marker with an open popup window (also called an "infowindow").  That got
populated with the <b>pointInfoUrl</b>, specified in the layerSpec.  
Note that the pointInfoUrl is just the prefix; the lat and long will get 
appended to the pointInfoUrl, so the whole URL will be something like<p>
<i>pointInfoUrl</i><code>lat=</code><i>lat=</i><code>&amp;lng=</code><i>lng</i>
</p>

For example, if <pre>
pointInfoUrl = "http://foo.com?field=library&amp;"
</pre> and the user clicks on longitude -105.3, latitude 37.5, then the
URL which will get fetched is <pre>
http://foo.com?field=library&amp;lat=-105.3&amp;lng=37.5
</pre>
<b>IMPORTANT! Your pointInfoUrl needs to end with a closing delimiter
(?, &amp;, or /) so that the extra stuff can get appended cleanly.</b>
<p>
If there are multiple visible layerSpecs with <b>pointInfoUrls</b>, then 
mapzarf will iterate through, from the top layer to the bottom layer,
and use the first <b>pointInfoUrl</b> it finds.
<p>
The HTML which is in the response to the URL will get stuffed into the 
infowindow.

<h2>City labels</h2>
In the previous example, you can see the roads and cities through the dot
layer.  But if you have a solid layer, those won't show through.  How do
you give your users some context about where they are?  With the cities
fields:
<ul>
<li><b>citiesUrl</b>: This URL gives some number of possible cities to show 
that are within the viewport.  More details below.</li>
<li><b>cityIconUrl</b>: This URL gives the icon of the name of the city.</li>
</ul>

The <b>citiesUrl</b> that you specified gets the following appended to it 
(sort of like in pointInfoUrl, above) in query string form before the 
request goes out, so you can return only cities in
the viewport:
<ul>
<li><b>upper</b>: the northern latitude of the viewport</li>
<li><b>lower</b>: the southern latitude of the viewport</li>
<li><b>left</b>: the western longitude of the viewport</li>
<li><b>right</b>: the eastern longitude of the viewport</li>
<li><b>zoom</b>: the current zoom level of the map</li>
<li><b>cartogram</b>: highly unlikely that you will care about this</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT! Your pointInfoUrl needs to end with a closing delimiter
(?, &, or /) so that the extra stuff can get appended cleanly.</b><p>

They response to that URL needs to be some number of the most important cities
in the viewport, be in JSON format as an ordered array of objects, 
and each object must have properties of the name, the latitude, and the 
longitude of that city.  When I do this, I return 25 cities, but here is
a made-up response with only three cities (for brevity):
<pre>
[{ "description":"New York", "lat":41.352122,"lng":-70.664961 },
{ "description":"Los Angeles", "lat":34.822085,"lng":-124.424735 },
{ "description":"Chicago", "lat":46.360331,"lng":-95.01061 }]
</pre>
You can read more about
<a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2013/11/17/city-labels-on-maps/">the 
algorithm for placing cities</a>.
<p>
The <b>cityIconUrl</b> needs to return an image with the name of the city.
I <i>strongly</i> advise you to return an image with an outline in a 
contrasting colour.  If you don't, I can pretty much guarantee you that
it will be difficult to see the label over <i>some</i> layer.  Here's 
an example (over a blue background) of the icons I make when I am making
maps:<p>
<img src="cityLabel.png" style="background-color:0000ff">
<p>
Here is an example of what the city labels look like over an opaque
data layer:<p>
<a href="http://localhost/maps/demos/taxRoi/mapzarf.html?lat=40.86783384138491&lng=-74.51751708984375&zoom=9&cartogram=f&showCities=t&showChoroplethLayers=t&choroplethLayersIndex=0&showBorderLayers=t&borderLayersIndex=0&showDotLayers=f"><img src="./cityLabels.png"></a><p>
(Note the legend in the upper right hovering over the data layer.)
